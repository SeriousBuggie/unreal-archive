## Game Type Additional Information

Feel free to add any additional write-up, documentation, installation help, 
etc. to this document. It's a regular 
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) document, and will be
formatted and rendered as HTML, along with the game type metadata from the
accompanying YAML file.

## Next Steps

A template `gametype.yml` file has been generated, you can populate it with all
the relevant information.

### Graphics

To use a custom graphic at the top of the page, place a 1200 x 150 pixel PNG
image in the game type directory named `banner.png`.

If screenshots or other graphics are to be included, they should be placed into
a directory called `gallery`. This directory will be turned into a thumbnail
gallery on the final page.
